# wodehouse_writers

This repository is an experiment in creating a different type of
P.G. Wodehouse fan fiction.

We should not try to write stories of Jeeves and Bertie and Blandings
Castle (these efforts are doomed for failure).

But we can try to write the works of the writers Wodehouse has
described.

So the effort has three parts that I can think of at this time

1. Identify all the authors that Wodehouse has parodied, giving as
   much information about them and their books as possible.  Right now
   I can think of:

   - Rosie M. Banks
     - Only a Factory Girl
     - Mervin Keene, Clubman
   - Felix Clovelly
     - Gridley Quayle Investigator: The Adventure of the Maharaja's Ruby
     - Gridley Quayle Investigator: The Adventure of the Secret Six
     - Gridley Quayle Investigator: The Adventure of the Wand of Death
   - Leila J. Pinkney
   - James Rodman
     - The Secret Nine
   - Whiffle
     - On the Care of the Pig

   See the document research/README.md for how we elaborate on this to
   create a solid background that can inform the books.

2. Encourage people to write the books, faithful to the tiny bits
   that Wodehouse previewed, but completing them.  They should be
   about the right length for the medium that published them.

3. Consider extending this by writing titles beyond what Wodehouse
   described.  For example, you might envision Gridley Quayle in a
   book with the title "Gridley Quayle Investigator: Peril at
   Haverscomb Mansion".

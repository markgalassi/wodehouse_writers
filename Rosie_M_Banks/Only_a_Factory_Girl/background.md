# Trivia

There is a 1911 Australian lost film called "Only a Factory Girl".
[Almost nothing is known about
it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_a_Factory_Girl)

The Random House publishing company once had a list of the 100 best
novels ever written.  A group of people on the Usenet group
``alt.fan.wodehouse`` were able to distort the voting to get this
fictional book into that list.  The publisher eventually noticed the
trick and replaced Only a Factory Girl with Tolkien.
